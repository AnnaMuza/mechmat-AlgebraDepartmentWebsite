    <h1><span>History of the Department</span></h1>
    <p>In September 1959, on the initiative of Lev Arkadyevich Kaluzhnin, a professor at the University of Berlin who moved to Kyiv in 1955, the Department of Algebra and Mathematical Logic was organized at the university. At that time, the department included: Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor L.A. Kaluzhnin (head of the department), Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Assistant T.O. Shub. A laboratory of mathematical linguistics was also established (jointly with the Department of General Linguistics). In the 1960s, V.A. Vyshensky, V.I. Belichkov (worked at the university from 1964 to 1969), V.V. Kyrychenko, and Y.A. Drozd were hired as assistants at the department.</p>
    <p>Since 1965, V.S. Charin, a renowned specialist in the field of topological algebra, began his scientific and pedagogical work as a professor at the Kyiv University. During this period, V.M. Glushkov, A.A. Letichevsky, V.G. Bodnarchuk (Institute of Cybernetics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine), A.V. Reuter, and I.D. Ivanyuta (Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine) were also involved in lecturing and conducting scientific seminars. Research was conducted on issues of mathematical linguistics, automata theory, and abstract Galois theory.</p>
    <p>Since 1960, a new direction in modern algebra – representation theory – began to develop in Kyiv. In 1970, L.A. Kaluzhnin took the position of professor at the Department of Algebra and Mathematical Logic, and the head of the department became Professor S.T. Zavalo, a student of the renowned algebraist O.G. Kurosh. In the 1970s, V.I. Sushchansky, V.V. Sergiychuk, and O.G. Ganyushkin began working at the department.</p>
    <p>During this time, research continued in the fields of permutation group theory, universal algebras, representation theory, and ring structural theory. Since the mid-1970s, research in computer algebra began at the department in collaboration with the Institute of Cybernetics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Algorithms and programs for calculations in group theory and algebraic combinatorics were developed, and two collections of scientific papers on these topics were published.</p>
    <p>In 1981, S.T. Zavalo took the position of professor at the department, where he worked until his untimely death in 1989. The head of the department became Associate Professor Y.A. Drozd. In the 1980s, there were several personnel changes at the department. Associate Professors V.O. Ustimenko and S.A. Ovsyenko, who had worked in scientific laboratories of the faculty, replaced L.A. Kaluzhnin (retired in 1986), V.V. Kyrychenko (became head of the Department of Geometry and Topology after defending his doctoral dissertation in 1986), and S.T. Zavalo (died in 1989). V.M. Futorniy was transferred from the Department of Mathematical Analysis to the position of assistant, and V.V. Bavula was also hired as an assistant after completing his postgraduate studies. In the mid-1990s, Associate Professors V.O. Ustimenko and V.V. Sergiychuk defended their doctoral dissertations at the specialized Scientific Council for the Defense of Doctoral Dissertations in Algebra and Number Theory (01.01.06) and Mathematical Logic, Algorithm Theory, and Discrete Mathematics (01.01.08), established at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics in 1993 (headed by Professor Y.A. Drozd). In 1995, Professor V.O. Ustimenko moved to a new position as head of the Department of Mathematics at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. From 1989 to 1996, V.V. Bavula worked as an assistant at the department (defended his doctoral dissertation in 1996). In the 1990s, the department began training highly qualified personnel through doctoral programs. In 1995, Assistant V.M. Futorniy completed his doctoral studies and defended his doctoral dissertation (in 1999, he moved to the position of senior research associate). From 1995 to 1998, Associate Professor S.A. Ovsyenko was in doctoral studies. He also became a Humboldt Fellow and interned for 1.5 years at Bielefeld University. From 1998 to 1999, Assistant V.S. Mazorchuk was a Humboldt Fellow and also interned at Bielefeld University. For his scientific research, V.S. Mazorchuk received the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Award for Young Scientists in 1997, and in 2000, at the age of 27, he defended his doctoral dissertation on the structure of generalized Verma modules, becoming the youngest Doctor of Science in Mathematics in Ukraine (currently working at Uppsala University, Sweden). Since 1998, the new head of the department and the new head of the specialized Council became Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor V.I. Sushchansky (Y.A. Drozd moved to the position of professor at the department), and since 2002, the head of the specialized Council became Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor V.V. Kyrychenko. Since 1997, candidates of physical and mathematical sciences A.S. Oliynyk, V.V. Nekrashevych (for their scientific research, V.V. Nekrashevych and A.S. Oliynyk became laureates of the Taras Shevchenko Prize of Kyiv University in 2000), O.O. Bezushchak (since 1998), S.V. Popovich (since 2000), and G.M. Kudryavtseva (since 2000) have started working as assistants. Since early 2005, the new head of the department has been Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor A.P. Petravchuk, who previously worked at the Department of Geometry.</p>

    <p>The algebraic school of Kyiv University, founded at the beginning of the 20th century by the prominent mathematician and mechanic D.O. Grave, is well known to the global mathematical community. His famous seminar, which studied problems of group theory and algebraic number theory, paved the way for such renowned scientists as M.P. Kravchuk, O.Yu. Schmidt, M.G. Chebotaryov, B.M. Delone, and A.M. Ostrovsky.</p>
    <p>The second birth of the algebraic school at Kyiv University owes much to Professor L.A. Kaluzhnin, who moved from Berlin to Kyiv in 1956, bringing with him the traditions and mathematical culture of the best universities in France and Germany. Among the alumni of this school are Professors V.V. Kyrychenko, Yu.A. Drozd, V.I. Sushchansky, O.H. Zavadsky, V.O. Ustymenko, Doctors of Physical and Mathematical Sciences V.V. Serheychuk, V.M. Futorny, V.V. Bavula, V.S. Mazorchuk, S.A. Ovsiienko, and Associate Professors V.V. Plakhotnyk, O.H. Haniushkin.</p>
    <p>In recent years, the research of the department's scientists has been conducted under the leadership of its head, Professor V.I. Sushchansky, and Professor Yu.A. Drozd in two main directions: the theory of transformation groups with applications in algebraic combinatorics and categorical-geometric methods of representations of algebraic structures. Specifically, V.I. Sushchansky and his students V.V. Nekrashevych and A.S. Oliinyk obtained significant results on the structure of automorphism groups of trees, laying the foundations of the theory of groups and semigroups of automaton transformations; together with O.H. Haniushkin, he characterized finite homogeneous metric spaces with a wide range of metric values, and together with O.O. Bezuschak, he characterized isometry groups of generalized Beriev metric spaces. Yu.A. Drozd developed techniques for applying matrix problems to the classification of Cohen-Macaulay modules and vector bundles, described stable homotopy types of polyhedra of dimensions less than 5, and, together with S.A. Ovsiienko, proved the convergence of the representational types of a locally finite-dimensional matrix problem and its factor under the free action of a torsion-free group.</p>
    <p>The school of representation theory was founded in the early 1960s when a seminar on homological algebra was conducted at the university by the Department of Algebra and Mathematical Logic under the guidance of A. Reuter. Participants in this seminar included Yu. Drozd, V. Kyrychenko, S. Kruhlak, and L. Nazarova. The first two became members of the department and laid the foundation for the development of the school of representation theory at the university.</p>
    <p>A distinctive feature of the school is the new, non-traditional sections of representation theory. The first studies conducted by its members concerned the theory of integral representations of rings, which was just beginning to develop at that time. This allowed the Kyiv school to become a leader in many areas. In particular, it achieved a thorough study of special classes of orders: hereditary, Bass, and quasi-Bass. A classical result of these studies was the criterion for the finiteness of the number of indecomposable representations for local orders, obtained in 1972 by Yu. Drozd and V. Kyrychenko. Not surprisingly, at the All-Union School on Representation Theory in Uzhhorod in September 1972, they reviewed the results of the theory of integral representations.</p>
    <p>Since the 1970s, the focus of research at the Kyiv school has shifted towards the theory of finite-dimensional algebras and a new method introduced in representation theory, primarily thanks to the work of Kyiv scientists: the method of "matrix problems." This method arose from the consideration of certain linear algebra problems that naturally arose in computing representations and gradually became one of the most effective means of both computation and qualitative investigation of representations. One of the most famous results in this direction was the theorem that every finite-dimensional algebra is either tame or wild, proved by Yu. Drozd in 1979. When it became possible for Kyiv scientists to participate in international conferences in the late 1980s, Yu. Drozd was invited to special sessions of the Banach Research Center (1988) and the London Mathematical Society (1989) to present this result. Since 1990, Yu. Drozd has been regularly invited to give special presentations at International Conferences on Representations of Algebras and Their Applications (ICRA), and since 1994 he has been a member of the scientific committee of these conferences.</p>
    <p>The most important results obtained by Yu. Drozd, S. Ovsiienko, V. Serheychuk, and their students include the theory of coverings for matrix problems and finite-dimensional algebras, and the theorem on the coincidence of representational types of an algebra and its covering; the theory of matrix problems with involution; the theory of A(G)-categories and derived categories for matrix problems, and more.</p>
    <p>Simultaneously with this direction, research related to the theory of orders and related issues of the general theory of rings and modules continues. The theory of chain rings, developed by V. Kyrychenko (which was the subject of a review presentation at the Banach Research Center in 1988), and the multiplicative theory of ideals of commutative rings, developed by Yu. Drozd, have received wide recognition. V. Bavula developed a new direction in the study of non-commutative affine algebras, primarily infinite-dimensional simple algebras. His results were presented at ICRA (in 1994, 1996, and 1998) and at International Conferences on Ring Theory in Antwerp (1997) and Edinburgh (1998).</p>
    <p>Since the 1980s, at the initiative of Yu. Drozd, research on the representation theory of algebras and Lie groups, an important field of modern mathematics that had not previously been developed in Ukraine, has begun. The most significant results in this area were obtained by V. Futorny. He developed the general theory of generalized Verma modules for both classical simple Lie algebras and affine algebras; in the latter case, he described all possible parabolic decompositions of root systems. These results have been repeatedly presented at meetings of the American and Canadian Mathematical Societies, at the Tata Institute (Bombay), the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, and more. Important results on the structure of weight modules over new classes of Lie algebras were obtained by V. Mazorchuk.</p>
    <p>In recent years, due to the establishment of extensive international connections, the school's research topics have continued to expand. They now include studies in algebraic geometry (the theory of singularities and vector bundles) and algebraic topology. In collaboration with German mathematicians, the theory of Cohen-Macaulay modules over one-dimensional singularities (both commutative and non-commutative) has been developed; vector bundles over projective curves (including singular ones) have been described; classifications of stable homotopy types of polyhedra in several new cases have been obtained; quadratic modules and some classes of cubic modules have been described. The results were presented at international scientific conferences on the theory of singularities (Oberwolfach, 1995, 1999) and on polynomial functor theory (Ringberg, 1999), as well as at the International Conference on Representation Theory in São Paulo (1999).</p>
    <p>An important direction of the school's activities is computer algebra and its applications to representation theory. S. Ovsiienko is a member of the International Coordination Committee on these issues, where Kyiv specialists collaborate fruitfully with scientists from Germany, the USA, Poland, Canada, and Mexico.</p>
    <p>During the existence of the school, six doctoral dissertations (Yu. Drozd, V. Kyrychenko, V. Serheychuk, V. Futorny, V. Bavula, V. Mazorchuk) and more than 20 candidate dissertations have been defended. Currently, the school includes about 20 scientists actively working in this field. The textbook "Finite-Dimensional Algebras" by Yu. Drozd and V. Kyrychenko was translated into English by Springer and has become the primary textbook for students of this theory worldwide. Since 1998, Yu. Drozd, together with A. Verschoren (Antwerp), has been publishing the international journal "Algebras and Representation Theory" (by Kluwer, Netherlands). The influence of the school extends to other regions of Ukraine, especially Lviv and Uzhhorod Universities. The school's graduates (five to six students annually) work throughout Ukraine and in many other countries worldwide. The scientific seminar on representation theory, led by Yu. Drozd and S. Ovsiienko, is a leader in its field. In 1997, Kyiv University hosted the International Conference on Representation Theory and Computer Algebra. About 40 scientists from abroad (Germany, the United Kingdom, the USA, Canada, Mexico, Poland, Norway, Romania) participated in it.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, an important direction of the algebraic school's activities is computer algebra and its application to representation theory.</p>
